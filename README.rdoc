== Cookbook Client, a.k.a. Spoon 

Spoon provides a command-line driven interface to the Opscode Cookbook Community Site, at
cookbooks.opscode.com. The command-line is driven by Chef::CookbookClient, an implementation
of the REST client API against the community site.

Run 'spoon' for help with the tool.
